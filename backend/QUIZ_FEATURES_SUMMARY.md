- ✅ **Role-based dependencies** (`require_admin()`, `require_student()`, `require_any_role()`)
- ✅ **JSON file storage** for users and questions
- ✅ **Admin user creation** for testing

### 📝 **Question Management (Admin Only)**
- ✅ **Question creation** with comprehensive validation
- ✅ **Question types**: Multiple choice, True/False, Short answer

- ✅ **Question filtering** by difficulty and tags
- ✅ **Question statistics** for admins
- ✅ **CRUD operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete

### 🛡️ **Security Features**
- ✅ **Role-based access control** - Students cannot access admin endpoints
- ✅ **Answer protection** - Students see questions without correct answers
- ✅ **Input validation** with Pydantic schemas
- ✅ **JWT token authentication** for all protected endpoints

### 📊 **Data Storage**
- ✅ **JSON file storage** for questions (`data/questions.json`)
- ✅ **JSON file storage** for users (`data/users.json`)
- ✅ **Proper serialization** of datetime objects
- ✅ **Data persistence** across server restarts

## 🎯 **API Endpoints Implemented**

### **Authentication**
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user profile

### **Question Management (Admin)**

- `GET /questions/{id}` - Get question with answer (admin only)
- `PUT /questions/{id}` - Update question
- `DELETE /questions/{id}` - Delete question
- `GET /questions/stats/count` - Get question statistics

### **Question Access (Students)**
- `GET /questions/{id}/student` - Get question without answer
- `GET /questions/` - Get questions with filtering

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### **Admin Features**
- ✅ Admin can create questions with all types and difficulties
- ✅ Admin can view questions with correct answers
- ✅ Admin can access question statistics
- ✅ Admin can filter and manage questions

### **Student Features**
- ✅ Students can view questions without seeing correct answers
- ✅ Students are blocked from admin endpoints (403 Forbidden)
- ✅ Students can filter questions by difficulty and tags
- ✅ Students can access question lists safely

### **Security Tests**
- ✅ Role-based access control working correctly
- ✅ JWT authentication working for all endpoints
- ✅ Answer protection working (students don't see correct answers)
- ✅ Input validation working for all question types
