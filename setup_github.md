# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Steps to Create and Upload to GitHub

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `adaptive-quiz-platform` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "A comprehensive learning platform with adaptive quiz functionality"
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

# Set the main branch (if not already set)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Example Commands (Replace with your actual details)

```bash
# Example for a repository named "adaptive-quiz-platform"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/adaptive-quiz-platform.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
